# ML for Polynomials
The first graduation project at GTU focused on generating always positive polynomials using machine learning models. This project utilized both Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). I collaborated with my friend Sare Nur AydÄ±n, with Sare working on the GAN implementation while I focused on the VAE approach.
